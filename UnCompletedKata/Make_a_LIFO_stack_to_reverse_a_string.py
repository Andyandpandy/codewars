def Lifo():
    """
    In this kata you have to implement a basic stack(LIFO) data structure. 
    
    You have to implement the following methods:

    __str__
          return a string "Stack of size: stack_size"  where stack_size is the current size of the stack
    
    isEmpty
          return true if its empty and false otherwise
    
    push
          add an element
    
    pop
          remove the top element and return it
     
    You should then implement the reverse_str method that takes as input 
    a string and a stack object and uses the stack to reverse the string.
    
    :return: the top element without removing it or None if empty
